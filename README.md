# SkillBridge AI

SkillBridge AI is a full-stack platform that connects student skills with relevant industry opportunities through skill assessment, role matching, and personalized insights.

The platform provides separate experiences for students, industry users, academicians, and institutions. Candidate-role matching uses deterministic scoring based on skill requirements, while an optional local Ollama layer can explain the results without modifying the underlying scores.
